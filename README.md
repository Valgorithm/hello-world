Hello, world!

Val here. Formerly a college dropout, I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 2012. I am taking a break from the corporate world at present in order to explore entrepreneurial and freelance possibilities. As I enjoy computer programming on a hobbyist level, I am currently teaching myself JavaScript and may desire to steer my career in the programming direction eventually.
